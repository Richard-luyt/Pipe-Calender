As I prepared for my final exams, I was inspired to create The **Water-Brick Calendar**, an innovative weekly planning app designed to revolutionize how you approach your daily tasks. This app leverages two powerful metaphors: bricks and water.

- **Bricks** symbolize your daily fixed commitmentsâ€”essential activities like jogging, reading, and other crucial tasks that keep your routine grounded.
- **Water**, on the other hand, signifies the flexible, fluid tasks that may extend over multiple days, allowing for adaptability and creativity in your planning.

By embracing this dynamic duality, The Water-Brick Calendar not only helps you establish a solid foundation for your daily activities but also empowers you to adjust and redistribute your efforts with ease, making it simple to carry over incomplete tasks without the stress of rigid deadlines. Experience the freedom of balanced planning and take control of your time like never before!
